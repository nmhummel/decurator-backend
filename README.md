**Description:**
I found a database of the artwork from the Modern Museum of Art (MoMA) in NYC. It was five years old but very thorough. Taking just the paintings with images, 
I seeded my backend API and ended up with 1,994 paintings. In this app, you can peruse all the paintings and save them to rooms you create and make your own exhibits.

**How to Get In on the Fun:**
* This project's backend/API was made with Ruby version: ruby 2.6.6p146 (2020-03-31 revision 67876) [x86_64-linux]
* Frontend courtesy of JavaScript, React, Redux, CSS, and HTML.
* Fork a copy and download the files from: 
    https://github.com/nmhummel/decurator-backend
    https://github.com/nmhummel/decurator-frontend
* Make sure you bundle install after cloning it.
* Run $rails db:migrate AND $rails db:seed to seed the database.
* System dependencies include a console of some sort: Windows Power Shell, Command Prompt, Ubuntu, etc.
* Start your rails server by going into the backend folder: 
    $cd backend
    $rails s 
* On the front end, start your npm server by going into the backend folder:
    $npm start or $yarn start
